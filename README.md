# Project Mongo API

First project working with a database, modeled data in Mongodb using Mongoose. 

## The problem

The API has 4 routes:

#1: "/songs" to view all data
#2: "/songs/pop" Filter on a specific genre and get top 5 in popularity
#3: "/songs/id/637f76ca41af53b76cbf1328" Filter on a specific song with an ID-number
#4: "songs/bpm/150"  Get names of the tracks with a selected bpm
